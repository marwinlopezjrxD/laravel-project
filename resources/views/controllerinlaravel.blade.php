- Display View(function on buttons i believe, and more).
- Handle Database(fetch, get, data, more like a CRUD. Creating,
Updating, and Deleting Data)

In Database, One must have a Recycle Bin

If you as a Developer wants to delete a Data, Make sure it is stored
in a Trash Bin, If you want to restore that data again.
